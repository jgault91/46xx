## Avaya Vantage Devices belong to this GROUP, etc and to the Android Avaya Breeze client SDK based application running on them.
##
## Note: Avaya Vantage Basic Application (as well to any other Android Avaya Breeze Client SDK based application) can use
## any configuration parameter defined in this file or even use their own NEW parameters configured
## in such file. It is the application responsibility to extract these parameters from the configuration
## file that Avaya Vantage Devices generates for the application. Only Android Avaya Breeze Client SDK Based application
## can access the configuration file generated by the Avaya Vantage Device according to 
## ACTIVE_CSDK_BASED_PHONE_APP configuration parameter. The configuration file generated by the Avaya Vantage devices for 
## the Android Avaya Breeze Client SDK based application includes analyzed version of this file, then configuration received 
## from Avaya Aura Device Services(if enabled) and then specific configurations parameters received from other sources such 
## as DHCP/LLDP/PPM/UI.
##
## Note for Avaya Vantage device and Avaya Vantage Basic Application (as well to any other Android Avaya Breeze Client SDK based application):
## Any parameter configured using this file can also be configured in Avaya Aura Device Services. AADS has higher precedence compare to this file
## download from HTTP/S file server.
## 
## Avaya Vantage Open application retrieves all its configuration from the Avaya MPS server. All Avaya Vantage configuration parameters are 
## applicable when Avaya Vantage Open application is used unless explicitly stated otherwise below. 
## Avaya Vantage open is NOT based on Avaya Breeze Client SDK.

##  forwarded to the secondary (PHY2) Ethernet interface, and tagged frames received on the
##  secondary Ethernet interface will have their VLAN ID changed to the value of PHY2VLAN and

##           H1xx sends tagged packets (L2Q==0 or 1 and VLANTEST==0 or timer < VLANTEST) and L2QVLAN<>0, else to both phone and PC ports.
##        2. No enforcement of PHY2VLAN and PHY2PRIO on tagged VLAN packets received from PC port. If VLANSEP==1,
##           H1xx sends tagged packets (L2Q==0 or 1 and VLANTEST==0 or timer < VLANTEST) and 0<>PHY2VLAN<>L2QVLAN<>0 then:
##           a. Untagged packets from PC port will be tagged with PHY2VLAN and priority==0. 
##           b. Tagged packets will be forwarded as tagged packets only if their VLAN equal to PHY2VLAN. 
##              Otherwise the packets from PC will be sent unmodified.
##           Only in case of VLANSEP==1,H1xx sends tagged packets (L2Q==0 or 1 and VLANTEST==0 or timer < VLANTEST) and 0<>PHY2VLAN<>L2QVLAN<>0, 
##           there will be full separation between PC and phone traffic. In all other cases, PC traffic can reach the phone.
##        3. When VLANSEP ==0, H1xx sends untagged packets even if L2Q==0 or 1 and VLANTEST==0 or timer < VLANTEST.
##       16xx H.323 R1.0 and later
## SET VLANSEP 0
##
## VLANSEPMODE specifies whether full VLAN separation will be enabled by the built-in Ethernet switch
##  while the telephone is tagging frames with a non-zero VLAN ID. This VLAN separation is enabled when:
##  VLANSEP=1, L2QVLAN<> PHY2VLAN (and both has value different than 0), L2Q is auto (0) or (1)  tagging. 
##  In this new VLAN separation scheme:
##  - Untagged packets from PC port will be forwarded to network port only as untagged packets.
##  - Tagged packets from PC port will be forwarded to network port only as tagged packets only in case 
##    their VLAN is equal to PHY2VLAN. 
##    In this mode, tagged and untagged packets from  PC port will never reach phone’s port. 
##  - Untagged packets from the network will be sent to the PC port only.
##  - Tagged packets from the network port will be sent to the PC port if their VLAN is equal to PHY2VLAN 
##    and to the phone if their VLAN is equal to L2QVLAN. 
##  - 802.1x/LLDP and Spanning tree packets are supported as in previous releases in this new mode.
##  When VLANSEPMODE is 0, then the VLAN separation is based on previous releases where untagged packets 
##  from PC port can reach the phone. 
##  Please note that PHY2PRIO is NOT supported when VLANSEPMODE is 1.

## Description
##     This parameter replaces SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST for dual mode phones. It is used on IPv6-only phones to provide the list of SIPv6 servers. 
##     SIPv4 servers are ignored in IPv6-only mode. It is used to select the registration address. 
##     The list has the following format: host[:port][;transport=xxx]
##     where:
##         - host: is an IP addresses in dotted-decimal format or hex format
##         - port: is the optional port number. If a port number is not specified the default 
##                 value (5060 for TCP, 5061 for TLS) will be used
##         - transport: is the optional transport type (where xxx is tls or tcp)  
##                      If a transport type is not specified the default value TLS will be used
##     A dual mode controller has addresses of both families within curly brackets.
##     A settings file example is:
##           SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST_2 "{[2007:7::5054:ff:fe35:c6e]:5060;transport=tcp, 47.11.15.142:5060;transport=tcp},
##                                  {[2007:7::5054:ff:fe80:d4b0]:5060;transport=tcp, 47.11.15.174:5060;transport=tcp}"
##     Dual mode phones use SIGNALING_ADDR_MODE to select SM IP addresses from SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST_2. 
##     If SIGNALING_ADDR_MODE is 4, register to the first IPv4 address in SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST_2.
##     IPv4 only phones use SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST. Dual mode phones use SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST if SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST_2 is not provided.
##     SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST_2 should only be used if IPv6 addresses (FQDN is not supported) may be used for SIP signaling.
##     SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST_2 should not be used if FQDN (DNS name format) is used for sip controllers.

## WIFISTAT specifies whether the user is given an option to enable Wi-Fi.
##  Value  Operation
##    0    Wi-Fi is disabled and the user is not given an option to enable it; the phone will only use the Ethernet interface.
##    1    The user is given an option to enable Wi-Fi; the phone will connect to Ethernet (Default), unless the UI is used to manually switch to Wi-Fi.
##    2    Wi-Fi is the preferred interface, but manual override to a different SSID or to Ethernet is allowed; the phone will connect to WLAN_ESSID (i.e., the pre-configured Wi-Fi
##          network) unless the phone UI is used to manually switch to another SSID or to Ethernet. Associated pre-configured Wi-Fi network security parameters must also be specified.
##  This parameter is supported by:
##       J100 SIP R2.0.0.0 and later; values 0-2 are supported.
##         Only J129 and J179 support a pluggable Wi-Fi/BT module (J139/J169 does not support Wi-Fi/BT). If the phone does not support Wi-Fi/BT, WIFISTAT will be internally set
##         to 0, regardless of the value received from 46xxsettings.txt.
##         The Administrator should always test a new settings file configuration on a single phone before committing it to several phones, as a configuration error (such as
##         specifying an incorrect WLAN_ESSID or Wi-Fi security settings) will cause phones to become disconnected from the network, necessitating manual correction on each
##         phone's local User Interface, as the phone will not be reachable via any other means.
##         If the phone is using the pre-configured network (i.e., Ethernet or a specific Wi-Fi WLAN_ESSID), and then the phone UI is used to manually switch to a different
##         network, the phone will enter Manual Network Configuration Mode, which will cause the phone to continue to connect to the manually-configured network on subsequent
##         reboots, regardless of the pre-configured network specified by WIFISTAT and any associated parameters.
##         There are 2 ways to return the phone to Automatic Network Configuration mode (i.e., to comply again with WIFISTAT, and if WIFISTAT=2, also WLAN_ESSID and
##         associated pre-configured Wi-Fi network security parameters):
##           - Use the phone's UI to explicitly toggle "Network config" from "Manual" to "Auto".
##           - Change WIFISTAT to 0 and reboot the phone, which will force the phone to use Ethernet, after which, WIFISTAT can be changed to the desired value and the phone
##             rebooted again.

##    1    ALL Wi-Fi connections are preserved when the device moves to logout state (and in particular, the active Wi-Fi connection remains as it is)(default)
##  Note: when WIFI_CON_STATUS_ON_LOGOUT is set to 1, then the Wi-Fi credentials are shared across all users. When WIFI_CON_STATUS_ON_LOGOUT is set to 0 (and the network mode is Wi-Fi), 
##  after each logout, then the new/same user is required to enter Wi-Fi credentials before being able to login. When there is no Wi-Fi connectivity, emergency calls cannot be established.

##############  SECURE SHELL (SSH) SETTINGS  ###############
##
## Note: The SSH server on the endpoints is used by Avaya Services only for debugging purposes only. 
## The SSH server supports only Avaya Services Logins ("craft" and "sroot").
## By enabling Avaya Services Logins you are granting Avaya access to your endpoints.
## This is necessary required to maximize the performance and value of your Avaya
## support entitlements, allowing Avaya to resolve product issues in a timely manner.
## In addition to enabling the Avaya Logins, the Avaya Product that the endpoints register with must be registered 
## using the Avaya Global Registration Tool (GRT, see https://grt.avaya.com) to be eligible for Avaya remote connectivity. 
## Please see the Avaya support site (support.avaya.com/registration) for additional information for registering products 
## and establishing remote access and alarming.
## By disabling Avaya Services Logins you are preventing Avaya access to
## your endpoints. This is not recommended, as it can impacts Avaya’s ability to provide
## support for the product. Unless the customer is well versed in managing the product
## themselves, Avaya Services Logins should not be disabled.
## The access to the SSH server is protected by ASG (Legacy authentication algorithm) 
## or EASG (new authentication algorithm). Enhanced Access Security Gateway (EASG) provides a more secure authentication 
## compared to ASG for SSH server access. Endpoints that support EASG are no longer support ASG.

##  Ring tone files must be single-channel WAV files
##   coded in ITU-T G.711 u-law or A-law PCM with 8-bit samples at 8kHz.
##  This parameter is supported by:
##       Avaya Vantage Devices SIP R1.1.0.0 and later; Avaya Vantage supports list of ringtones files (without the tuple format) if the files are stored in the same directory as FILE_SERVER_URL points to. 
##                                                     If a different directory is needed, then the tuple format shall be used and the format shall be <filename with suffix>=”path/filename”.  
##                                                     For example: “name.wav/mp3/ogg=URI”.

##    2  Erase on reset.
##    3  Numeric One Time Password.
##    4  Alpha-Numeric One Time Password.
##    5  Erase on VPN Termination
## Description
##    This variables determines how password should be treated. By default 
##    password type is set to 1. You must set this variable to 3 or 4 if
##    using One Time Password such as SecureID from RSA. 
## Note 
##    Setting password type to 3 will not let the user select "Alpahbets" 
##    while entering password. This might look like an obvious choice when
##    using RSA secure ID tokens. However under some conditions user may 
##    need to respond back by entering 'y' or 'n' in the password field.
##    This could happen if RSA ACE server is configured to generate PIN 
##    instead of letting the user select a PIN.
## Example : Setting password type to 2 (Erase on reset)
## SET NVVPNPSWDTYPE 1
##
## NVVPNCOPYTOS
## Valid Values
##    1  YES
##    2  NO
## Description 
##    Value of this variable decides whether TOS bits should be copied from
##    inner header to outer header or not. If it's value is 1, TOS bits are
##    copied otherwise not. By default TOS bits are not copied from inner
##    header to outer header. Some Internet Service Provider don't route the
##    IP packets properly if TOS bits are set to anything other than 0.
## Example
##    SET NVVPNCOPYTOS 1
## Note
##    It is highly recommended that this value should not be changed if phone
##    is downloading the script over the VPN tunnel in order to avoid 
##    overriding end user setting due to ISP specific issues. For example you
##    can set this value to 1 while provisioning phone with VPN firmware so 
##    that phone can take advantage of QOS service provided by home router but
##    if the phone's ISP (Few percent cases) does not handle properly the 
##    packets with non-zero TOS bits in IP header, phone user will have to
##    revert back this value to 2. Under such circumstances it is desirable
##    the user's choice don't get overriden every time script is downloaded.
## Example: Setting NVVPNCOPYTOS to 1 if script is not downloaded over VPN tunnel.
##    IF $VPNACTIVE SEQ 1 GOTO skipcopytos
##    SET NVVPNCOPYTOS 1
##    # skipcopytos
## SET NVVPNCOPYTOS 2
##
## NVVPNENCAPS
## Valid Values
##    0  4500-4500
##    1  Disable
##    2  2070-500
##    4  RFC (As per RFC 3947 and 3948)
## Description
##    Type of UDP encapsulation method to use if there is a NAT device between
##    phone and the security gateway. By default UDP Encapsulation 4500-4500
##    is used. 
##    If NVVPNENCAPS is 0, ike negotiation starts with source port of 2070
##       and destination port 500. Negotiation switches to port source port
##       4500 and destination port 4500 if peer supports port floating (Ref 
##       RFC 3947,3948). Finally IPsec traffic is send inside UDP packets 
##       from/to port 4500 if supported by peer or port 2070<->500 if port
##       floating is not supported but UDP encapsulation is supported as 
##       published in the initial draft versions of RFC 3947 and 3948.
##     If NVVPNENCAPS is 1, ike nat traversal is completly disabled.
##     If NVVPNENCAPS is 2, Port floating is disabled during IKE nat traversal.
##     If NVVPNENCAPS is 4, ike negotiation starts with source port of 500 and
##       destination port 500. Negotiation switches to port source port 4500
##       and destination port 4500 if peer supports port floating (Ref RFC 3947
##       and 3948). Finally IPsec traffic is send inside UDP packets from/to 
##       port 4500 if supported by peer or port 500<->500 if port floating is 
##       not supported but UDP encapsulation is supported as published in the
##       initial draft versions of RFC 3947 and 3948.
## Note
##    UDP Encapsulation causes overhead hence it might be desirable to disable
##    udp encapsulation if NAT device supports IPsec pass through and there is
##    only one IPsec client behind the NAT connecting to the same security 
##    gateway. However not all devices support IPsec pass through hence this
##    value must not be pushed if phone is downloading the script over the VPN tunnel.
## Example : Setting NVVPNENCAPS to 1 if script is not downloaded over VPN tunnel.
##
##          IF $VPNACTIVE SEQ 1 goto skipencaps
##          SET NVVPNENCAPS 1
##          # skipencaps
##
## The example above will set NVVPNENCAPS to 1 if script is not downloaded over the tunnel.
## SET NVVPNENCAPS 0
##
## NVIKEPSK
## Valid Values
##    String. Length of the string cannot exceed 30 characters.
## Description
##    Preshared Key to use during phase 1 negotiation.
## Note 
##    It is recommened that user enter his/her Preshared Key using phone's 
##    dialpad. However if you don't want to share PSK with the end user 
##    because it's common for multiple users you can use this variable to 
##    push PSK (Group password) to each phone and the end user will never
##    know what the PSK is. But if you are doing this, make sure that the file 
##    server is on an isolated network and is used only for provisioning
##    VPN parameters to the phones.
## Example : Setting abc1234 as Preshared Key
## SET NVIKEPSK abc1234
##
## NVIKEID
## Valid Values 
##     String. Length of the string cannot exceed 30 characters.
## Description
##     Phone uses this string as IKE Identifier during phase 1 negotiation. 
##     Some XAuth documentation refer to this variable as group name because 
##     same IKE Id is shared among a group of user and indvidual user 
##     authentication is done using XAuth after establishing IKE phase 1 
##     security association.
##  The default value is "VPNPHONE".
## SET NVIKEID phones@sales.com

##    11   KEY-ID (Opaque)
## Description
##    Phone uses this variable as the IKE Identifier type for the 
##    IKE-ID specified via NVIKEID variable.

##    This variable default value depends on the value of variable NVVPNCFGPROF.
## SET NVIKEIDTYPE 2
##
## NVIPSECSUBNET
## Valid Values
##     Comma separated list of strings containing subnet and masks. Number of
##     strings cannot exceed 5.
## Description
##     This variable contains IP subnets protected by the security gateway.
##     By default phone assumes that all the network resources are behind 
##     the security gateway hence it negotiates for a security association
##     between it's IP address (or Virtual IP if delevired via IKE Config 
##     mode) and 0.0.0.0 with the security gateway. If your security gateway
##     is configured to allow building security association for only selected
##     subnets, you can specify them here.
## Example : 
##     Configuring 10.1.12.0/24 and 172.16.0.0/16 as the subnets protected by
##     the Security Gateway
##     SET NVIPSECSUBNET 10.1.12.0/24,172.16.0.0/16

##    6    IPv6
## Description
##     Control whether an IPv4 or an IPv6 address returned by DNS would be
##     tried first during dual-mode operation.
##     In general, if dual-stack operation is enabled, whether IPv4 or IPv6
##     is to be used to contact a server is determined by the value of the 
##     parameter that contains the server address(es). However, if the value
##     is a DNS name and if DNS returns both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address, 
##     the order in which they will be tried will be based on the order in
##     which they are returned to the application by the DNS resolver, which 
##     is controlled by the parameter 
## Example : Setting preference to IPv4
##            SET IPPREF 4
##  This parameter is supported by:
##       J169/J179 H.323 R6.7 and later

##       2. Whether an IPv4 or IPv6 addresses returned by DNS would be tried first during dual-mode operation.
## DHCP clients use DUAL_IPPREF to decide which SSON configuration attributes to apply for DHCPv4/DHCPv6 interworking in dual mode. Based on DUAL_IPPREF the phone selects SSON attributes either from DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 server.
##     If DNS server name is provided, and if DNS resolver returns both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, the order in which they will be tried will be based on DUAL_IPPREF parameter.
## NOTE: SIP server FQDNs are resolved into addresses that are ordered based on SIGNALING_ADDR_MODE, not DUAL_IPPREF
## Example: Setting preference to IPv4

##
## SIGNALING_ADDR_MODE
## Valid Values
##    4    IPv4 (default)
##    6    IPv6 
## Description
##     This parameter is used by SIP signaling on a dual mode phone (phone with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses configured) to select the preferred SIP controller  IP addresses
##     from SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST_2. The phone registers to SIP controllers using IPv4 address if SIGNALING_ADDR_MODE=4,
##     otherwise registration is over IPv6. 
##     The single IPv4 mode phone ignores SIGNALING_ADDR_MODE and SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST_2 and selects the SIP controller's IP addresses from SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST.
##     The single IPv6 mode phone ignores SIGNALING_ADDR_MODE and SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST and selects the SIP controller's IPv6 addresses from SIP_CONTROLLER_LIST_2.
## This parameter is supported by:

##           It is used by a dual mode answerer in non-Avaya environment to allow a local preference
##           It is used in non-Avaya environment to allow a local preference.
##     NOTE: Not applicable on single mode phones.
## Description
##     MEDIA_NEG_PREFERENCE option is used by the answerer only to change the default address 
##     family preference.
##     In dual IPv4/IPv6 mode, during SIP ANAT negotiation, 
##     MEDIA_NEG_PREFERENCE is used to prioritize media lines in SDP. 
##     By default offerer's preference is used. 
##
##     MEDIA_NEG_PREFERENCE of zero means when there is a choice between IPv4 and IPv6 address, 
##     the answerer honors the offerer's preference.
## This parameter is supported by:
##       J169/J179 SIP R1.5.0; J100 SIP R2.0.0.0 and later, J139 SIP R3.0.0.0 and later

##  If the DISCOVER_AVAYA_ENVIRONMENT parameter value is 1, the phone discovers (determines) 
##  if that controller supports the AST feature set or not. The phone will send a SUBSCRIBE 
##  request to the active controller for the Feature Status Event Package (avaya-cm-feature-status).
##  If the request succeeds, then the phone proceeds with PPM Synchronization.
##  If the request is rejected, is proxied back to the phone or does not receive a response, 
##  the phone will assume that AST features are not available.
##  If the parameter value is 0, the phone operates in a mode where AST features are not available.
##  Note: This parameter is supported on R2.4.1 and later release of 96xx SIP telephones, H1xx SIP R1.0 and later
##  and J129  SIP  R1.0.0.0 (or R1.1.0.0), J100 SIP R2.0.0.0 and later and J139 SIP R3.0.0.0 and later.
