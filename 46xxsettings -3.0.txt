##    2  Erase on reset.
##    3  Numeric One Time Password.
##    4  Alpha-Numeric One Time Password.
##    5  Erase on VPN Termination
## Description
##    This variables determines how password should be treated. By default 
##    password type is set to 1. You must set this variable to 3 or 4 if
##    using One Time Password such as SecureID from RSA. 
## Note 
##    Setting password type to 3 will not let the user select "Alpahbets" 
##    while entering password. This might look like an obvious choice when
##    using RSA secure ID tokens. However under some conditions user may 
##    need to respond back by entering 'y' or 'n' in the password field.
##    This could happen if RSA ACE server is configured to generate PIN 
##    instead of letting the user select a PIN.
## Example : Setting password type to 2 (Erase on reset)
## SET NVVPNPSWDTYPE 1
##
## NVVPNCOPYTOS
## Valid Values
##    1  YES
##    2  NO
## Description 
##    Value of this variable decides whether TOS bits should be copied from
##    inner header to outer header or not. If it's value is 1, TOS bits are
##    copied otherwise not. By default TOS bits are not copied from inner
##    header to outer header. Some Internet Service Provider don't route the
##    IP packets properly if TOS bits are set to anything other than 0.
## Example
##    SET NVVPNCOPYTOS 1
## Note
##    It is highly recommended that this value should not be changed if phone
##    is downloading the script over the VPN tunnel in order to avoid 
##    overriding end user setting due to ISP specific issues. For example you
##    can set this value to 1 while provisioning phone with VPN firmware so 
##    that phone can take advantage of QOS service provided by home router but
##    if the phone's ISP (Few percent cases) does not handle properly the 
##    packets with non-zero TOS bits in IP header, phone user will have to
##    revert back this value to 2. Under such circumstances it is desirable
##    the user's choice don't get overriden every time script is downloaded.
## Example: Setting NVVPNCOPYTOS to 1 if script is not downloaded over VPN tunnel.
##    IF $VPNACTIVE SEQ 1 GOTO skipcopytos
##    SET NVVPNCOPYTOS 1
##    # skipcopytos
## SET NVVPNCOPYTOS 2
##
## NVVPNENCAPS
## Valid Values
##    0  4500-4500
##    1  Disable
##    2  2070-500
##    4  RFC (As per RFC 3947 and 3948)
## Description
##    Type of UDP encapsulation method to use if there is a NAT device between
##    phone and the security gateway. By default UDP Encapsulation 4500-4500
##    is used. 
##    If NVVPNENCAPS is 0, ike negotiation starts with source port of 2070
##       and destination port 500. Negotiation switches to port source port
##       4500 and destination port 4500 if peer supports port floating (Ref 
##       RFC 3947,3948). Finally IPsec traffic is send inside UDP packets 
##       from/to port 4500 if supported by peer or port 2070<->500 if port
##       floating is not supported but UDP encapsulation is supported as 
##       published in the initial draft versions of RFC 3947 and 3948.
##     If NVVPNENCAPS is 1, ike nat traversal is completly disabled.
##     If NVVPNENCAPS is 2, Port floating is disabled during IKE nat traversal.
##     If NVVPNENCAPS is 4, ike negotiation starts with source port of 500 and
##       destination port 500. Negotiation switches to port source port 4500
##       and destination port 4500 if peer supports port floating (Ref RFC 3947
##       and 3948). Finally IPsec traffic is send inside UDP packets from/to 
##       port 4500 if supported by peer or port 500<->500 if port floating is 
##       not supported but UDP encapsulation is supported as published in the
##       initial draft versions of RFC 3947 and 3948.
## Note
##    UDP Encapsulation causes overhead hence it might be desirable to disable
##    udp encapsulation if NAT device supports IPsec pass through and there is
##    only one IPsec client behind the NAT connecting to the same security 
##    gateway. However not all devices support IPsec pass through hence this
##    value must not be pushed if phone is downloading the script over the VPN tunnel.
## Example : Setting NVVPNENCAPS to 1 if script is not downloaded over VPN tunnel.
##
##          IF $VPNACTIVE SEQ 1 goto skipencaps
##          SET NVVPNENCAPS 1
##          # skipencaps
##
## The example above will set NVVPNENCAPS to 1 if script is not downloaded over the tunnel.
## SET NVVPNENCAPS 0
##
## NVIKEPSK
## Valid Values
##    String. Length of the string cannot exceed 30 characters.
## Description
##    Preshared Key to use during phase 1 negotiation.
## Note 
##    It is recommened that user enter his/her Preshared Key using phone's 
##    dialpad. However if you don't want to share PSK with the end user 
##    because it's common for multiple users you can use this variable to 
##    push PSK (Group password) to each phone and the end user will never
##    know what the PSK is. But if you are doing this, make sure that the file 
##    server is on an isolated network and is used only for provisioning
##    VPN parameters to the phones.
## Example : Setting abc1234 as Preshared Key
## SET NVIKEPSK abc1234
##
## NVIKEID
## Valid Values 
##     String. Length of the string cannot exceed 30 characters.
## Description
##     Phone uses this string as IKE Identifier during phase 1 negotiation. 
##     Some XAuth documentation refer to this variable as group name because 
##     same IKE Id is shared among a group of user and indvidual user 
##     authentication is done using XAuth after establishing IKE phase 1 
##     security association.
##  The default value is "VPNPHONE".
## SET NVIKEID phones@sales.com

##    3    User-FQDN (E-Mail)
##    9    Directory-Name
##    11   KEY-ID (Opaque)
## Description
##    Phone uses this variable as the IKE Identifier type for the 
##    IKE-ID specified via NVIKEID variable.
## Note
##    This variable default value depends on the value of variable NVVPNCFGPROF.
## SET NVIKEIDTYPE 2
##
## NVIPSECSUBNET
## Valid Values
##     Comma separated list of strings containing subnet and masks. Number of
##     strings cannot exceed 5.
## Description
##     This variable contains IP subnets protected by the security gateway.
##     By default phone assumes that all the network resources are behind 
##     the security gateway hence it negotiates for a security association
##     between it's IP address (or Virtual IP if delevired via IKE Config 
##     mode) and 0.0.0.0 with the security gateway. If your security gateway
##     is configured to allow building security association for only selected
##     subnets, you can specify them here.
## Example : 
##     Configuring 10.1.12.0/24 and 172.16.0.0/16 as the subnets protected by
##     the Security Gateway
##     SET NVIPSECSUBNET 10.1.12.0/24,172.16.0.0/16

##     Control whether an IPv4 or an IPv6 address returned by DNS would be
##     tried first during dual-mode operation.
##     In general, if dual-stack operation is enabled, whether IPv4 or IPv6
##     is to be used to contact a server is determined by the value of the 
##     parameter that contains the server address(es). However, if the value
##     is a DNS name and if DNS returns both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address, 
##     the order in which they will be tried will be based on the order in
##     which they are returned to the application by the DNS resolver, which 
##     is controlled by the parameter 
## Example : Setting preference to IPv4
##            SET IPPREF 4
## SET IPPREF 6
##
## IPV6STAT
## Valid Values
##    0    IPv6 will not be supported.
